### Features

- Encrypt event data using a hybrid approach with RSA and AES encryption
- Customize the events and commands to track
- Simple and intuitive API for easy integration

### Installation

Install analytics-go using go get:

```shell
go get github.com/TONSolutions/telemetree-go
```

### Usage

Connect the client to your webhook, or pass the event data directly:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/TONSolutions/telemetree-go"
)

func main() {
	// Create a Telemetree SDK client by providing the Project ID and API Key
	client, err := telemetree.NewClient(
		"YOUR_PROJECT_ID",       // Unique identifier for your project
		"YOUR_API_KEY",          // API key for authentication
	)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating client:", err)
		return
	}

	// Send an event with user and event data
	err = client.Track(telemetree.Event{
		TelegramID: 112294972,     // User's Telegram ID (required)
		EventType:  "web",  // Event type (required)
		IsPremium:  true,          // Premium status flag (optional)

		// The following fields are optional:
		Username:     "username",  // Username
		Firstname:    "firstname", // First name
		Lastname:     "Lastname",  // Last name
		Language:     "en",        // User's language
		ReferrerType: "web",       // Traffic source type
		Referrer:     "0",         // Traffic source
	})

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error sending event:", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println("Event sent successfully")
}
```

### Encryption

The SDK uses RSA encryption to secure event data before sending it to the Telemetree service, ensuring data privacy. The `publicKey` is fetched automatically from the Telemetree configuration service during initialization, so thereâ€™s no need to manually set it.

## Other SDKs
Telemetree SDKs are available for various frameworks and environments, making it easy to incorporate powerful analytics into any Telegram Mini App.
